* Changes in 0.1.114 relative to 0.1.113:
** internal changes

* Changes in 0.1.113 relative to 0.1.112:
** bugfix: the ENP score editor handles dynamic markings as groups
   that are attached to a number of chords (possibly overlapping).

   As a simple example consider a measure with 4 chords and a dynamic
   group "p" that spans the entire measure. In the MusicXML export a
   dynamic marking was created for every chord (p p p p). This has
   been fixed now, so that a dynamic marking is only notated at the
   beginning of each dynamic group.

   Even the case of multiple dynamic markings for a single chord,
   which ENP allows, should be exported equivalently to the MusicXML.
 
* Changes in 0.1.112 relative to 0.1.111:
** new feature: wedges

* Changes in 0.1.111 relative to 0.1.110:
** new feature: slurs
   NB: in ENP the slurs needs to be attached to chord, not to
   individual notes

* Changes in 0.1.110 relative to 0.1.109:
** bugfix: beaming information is ok now

* Changes in 0.1.109 relative to 0.1.99:
** feature: added support for nested tuplets

* Changes in 0.1.99 relative to 0.1.95:
** feature: added support for eighth-tones; this special encoding
   needs to be enabled via the EIGHTH-TONE-ENCODING setting in the
   Edit Preferences... dialog

* Changes in 0.1.95 relative to 0.1.92:
** internal: big refactoring resulting in the new function CONVERT-NOTE:
   "A single function for creating a rest or an individual note of a chord."
   
* Changes in 0.1.92 relative to 0.1.89:
** bugfix: rests also need beam begin / continue / end information

* Changes in 0.1.89 relative to 0.1.88:
** feature: for debugging, the exporter performs a self-validating
   check on the beaming information that it generates

* Changes in 0.1.88 relative to 0.1.87:
** bugfix: rest handling within tuplets
** bugfix: rests can carry an expression

* Changes in 0.1.87 relative to 0.1.86:
** bugfix tuplets: always provide a "normal-number"

* Changes in 0.1.86 relative to 0.1.85:
** New feature: added support for dynamics: f, p, sfz...

* Changes in 0.1.85 relative to 0.1.84:
** Rests inside tuplets had an incorrect time-modification
   information. This actually assigned them a wrong duration and
   tuplet brackets would not lign up correctly at the end of the
   tuplet.

* Changes in 0.1.84 relative to 0.1.83:
** Fixed a bug where a grace note between two pairs of
   eighth notes would result in incorrect beaming   

* Changes in 0.1.83 relative to 0.1.82:
** In PWGL you can use durations for a single chord of "5",
   notated with a + instead of a dot. This notation does not seem to
   be possible in MusicXML. This was fixed this in a way that the
   chord is split into 3 + 2 with a tie.
